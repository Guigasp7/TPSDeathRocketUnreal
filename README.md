# Death Rocket (TPS - Console)

Death Rocket is a third person shooter. We have to kill opponents with rocket launcher and capture flag zone to take the advantage. We can play in solo with the training map and in 1VS1 and 2VS2. We have a grappling hook to travel the map faster, find strategic zone or try to escape the opponent in dangerous situation.
